# Warehouse-Storage-Simulator
I wrote methods and classes in Java for the development of a storage simulator to illustrate how much storage is available in a particular warehouse as well as where in the simulated space the allocated storage is. Employed 2 data structures (Hash Tables and Priority Queues) to maximize the efficiency and efficacy of the code.
